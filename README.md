# Canonical Correlation in Bank Marketing data set

_banktest.jl_ implements methods to aply canonical correlation on the bank marketing dataset freely available at the [Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)

Compatible with Julia v1.0. Most of the methods are aimed at preprocessing. Methods for the actual cannonical correlation analysis were also implemented, instead of using MultivariateStats.jl package.

To  be implemented in the future:

 - Visualisation methods
 - Bootstrapping methods to resample data in order to balance the dataset
